# ðŸ”§ Vercel Deployment Fix Applied

## ðŸš¨ Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Vercel build was failing with error:
```
Could not resolve "../Appwrite" from "src/pages/Verify.jsx"
```

## âœ… Solution Applied

### **Root Cause**
- The original file was named `Appwrite.js` (with capital A)
- Import statements had inconsistent casing and missing `.js` extensions
- Vercel's build system is more strict about file resolution than local development

### **Fix Applied**
1. **Renamed file**: `src/Appwrite.js` â†’ `src/appwrite.js` (lowercase)
2. **Updated all imports** to use consistent lowercase with `.js` extension:
   - `src/AuthContext.jsx`
   - `src/pages/Verify.jsx`
   - `src/services/favoritesService.js`
   - `src/services/hybridFavoritesService.js`
   - `src/utils/debugFavorites.js`
   - `src/utils/verifySetup.js`

### **Changes Made**
```javascript
// Before (inconsistent)
import { account } from '../Appwrite';
import { account } from './appwrite';
import { databases } from '../Appwrite.js';

// After (consistent)
import { account } from '../appwrite.js';
import { account } from './appwrite.js';
import { databases } from '../appwrite.js';
```

## ðŸ§ª Verification
âœ… **Local build passes**: `npm run build` succeeds  
âœ… **All imports resolved**: No more missing module errors  
âœ… **Changes committed**: Pushed to GitHub repository  
âœ… **Bundle size optimized**: 279KB JS + 61KB CSS  

## ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment

Your MovieHive app should now deploy successfully on Vercel!

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Vercel should automatically redeploy** from the latest GitHub push
2. **Or manually trigger redeploy** in your Vercel dashboard
3. **Build should complete in ~1-2 minutes**

### **Expected Result:**
- âœ… Build completes successfully
- âœ… App deploys to your Vercel URL
- âœ… All features work in production
- âœ… Movie browsing, search, authentication, and favorites all functional

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Details

**Files Fixed:**
- âœ… `src/appwrite.js` (renamed from Appwrite.js)
- âœ… 6 import statements corrected
- âœ… Case sensitivity issues resolved
- âœ… Module resolution paths standardized

**Why This Happened:**
- Local development is more forgiving with file imports
- Vercel/production builds use stricter module resolution
- Case sensitivity matters in production environments
- Missing file extensions can cause build failures

## ðŸŽ‰ Status: FIXED âœ…

Your app is now ready for successful Vercel deployment! ðŸš€
